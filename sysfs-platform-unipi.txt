What:		/sys/devices/platform/unipi_plc/plc_group[1-9]/di_[1-9]/ds_enable
Date:		January 2018
Contact:	Tomas Knot <tomasknot@gmail.com>
Description:
		This file allows enabling the DirectSwitch feature for one of the inputs
		on the Neuron PLC group specified by the [1-9] address. Reading the file
		returns a string of 0s and 1s, where for each input there is a single
		character indicating whether the DirectSwitch feature is enabled or not.
		
		Writing a positive number to the file turns the DirectSwitch feature on
		for the nth input in the group (where n is the absolute value of the 
		number written), while writing a negative number turns DirectSwitch
		for the corresponding input off.  Writing a 0 to the file has no effect.
		
What:		/sys/devices/platform/unipi_plc/plc_group[1-9]/di_[1-9]/ds_polarity
Date:		January 2018
Contact:	Tomas Knot <tomasknot@gmail.com>
Description:
		This file allows switching the polarity of the DirectSwitch feature for
		one	of the inputs on the Neuron PLC group specified by the [1-9] address.
		Reading the file returns a string of 0s and 1s, where for each input
		there is a single character indicating whether the DirectSwitch feature
		polarity is inverted or not.

		Writing a positive number to the file inverts the DirectSwitch feature
		polarity for the nth input in the group (where n is the absolute value
		of the number written), while writing a negative number switches the 
		DirectSwitch feature back to normal polarity mode.
		Writing a 0 to the file has no effect.

Description:
		This file allows enabling the toggle function for the DirectSwitch 
		feature on one of the inputs on the Neuron PLC group specified by
		the [1-9] address. Reading the file	returns a string of 0s and 1s,
		where for each input there is a single character indicating whether
		the toggle function for the DirectSwitch feature is enabled or not.
		
		Writing a positive number to the file turns the DirectSwitch toggle 
		function on	for the nth input in the group (where n is the absolute
		value of the number written), while writing a negative number turns
		DirectSwitch for the corresponding input off.  Writing a 0 to the
		file has no effect.
