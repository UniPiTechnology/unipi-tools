Regmap Data Format

- Defines which contain the length of the model definition, one for each model
- Each define uses the following naming format: NEURONSPI_MODEL_XYZ_HW_DEFINITION_SIZE
- Definition itself is a data structure in the following format:
	u16 Number of Neuron modules
	Module (Combination) Definition pointer<number of modules>
- Each board module definition is preceded by a define with the following name: NEURONSPI_BOARD_L[0-9][0-9][0-9]U[0-9][0-9][0-9]_HW_DEFINITION_SIZE, where L is the lower board id and U is the upper board id, and which specifies the definition length for the combination
- Module definitions are in the following format:
	 u16 Lower board ID
	 u16 Upper board ID
	 u32 Number of Blocks
	 Register block struct:
		u32 Block starting register
		u32 Block register count
		[u32]<register count> Register type flags
